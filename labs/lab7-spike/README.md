# Lab 7 - Cache Simulation

The goals of this lab are:

* Improve understanding of the impact of cache parameters on performance
* Provide an example of how researchers evaluate different parameters.

In this lab, you will experiment with the design of a cache system for the RISCV processor using the spike simulator (under the virtual machine from the previous lab). Spike simulates a variety of cache configurations, where the various cache parameters (e.g. associativity level, cache size, block size) can be specified on the command line.

If you have previously downloaded all the labs using git clone https://github.com/phwl/elec3608-lab.git, you should first type ```git pull``` to download any recent changes. Please note that we are using a different docker image (elec3608-riscv:latest) for this lab, executed as:

You can run the Docker using:

```
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -v `pwd`:/config phwl/elec3608-riscv:latest
```

The command line arguments for spike can be obtained by invoking spike with the -h argument:

```

the above simulated a RISCV processor with the following cache

```
S=2 sets
W=4 ways
B=8-byte blocks.
```

To see how sets and ways interact, this figure which shows four configurations of 8-block caches is helpful

![eightblock](eightblock.png "eightblock")

A direct mapped cache has ways=1, and a fully associative cache has sets=1. The total size of the cache in bytes is S*W*B (or S*W blocks).Â 

## Question 1

The easiest way to do this lab is by writing one or more programs (in your favourite language such as C, C++ or python) that automates the tasks. My suggestion is to use python which is installed in the docker image. Subsequent plotting and data analysis can be done using MS excel, MATLAB or other tools. Although you can do it manually, it would be slow, inflexible and error-prone.

a. (20%) Assume that the hit time is 1 cycle and the miss penalty is 10 cycles. For the I$ and D$ cache simulations given in the example above, what is the average memory access time (AMAT) for each? Show your working.

b. (50%) A RISCV processor has no L2 cache, the instruction and data caches are identical, direct mapped caches and have 16-byte blocks. Plot instruction and data miss rates as a function of the cache size (which are powers of 2) on a single graph for the dhrystone program. What cache size is required to obtain a miss rate of less than 5% for the instruction and data cache?

c. (30%) Suppose that memory costs ($0.1 + $0.0001 * b) where b is the size of the cache in bytes. We wish to minimise (AMAT * memory cost) for the L1 cache over the dhrystone application. Constraints are that the data (D) and instruction (I) caches can be different sizes, but each cache's S, W and B must be a power of 2. What are the cache parameters (S:W:B) that should be chosen for the I cache and the D cache?
